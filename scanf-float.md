## Understanding `scanf`, `float`, and Scientific Notation in C

### Introduction
Scientific notation is widely used in programming to represent very large or very small numbers efficiently. In embedded systems, where precision is crucial, floating-point numbers and scientific notation play an important role. 

In this exercise, we will calculate the **number of electrons** responsible for producing a given charge using **scientific notation for both input and output**.

### Formula:
The number of electrons is calculated as:

```
Number of electrons = Given Charge / Charge of an Electron
```

Since the charge of an **electron** is a very small number (**1.602 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Åπ C**), we use scientific notation to handle such values efficiently.

### Corrected C Program with Explanations
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    double charge, chargeE, electrons; // Use double for higher precision
    
    // Prompt user for charge input
    printf("Enter the charge (in Coulombs, e.g., 1.5e-6): ");
    scanf("%le", &charge);  // %le is used for scientific notation (double)
    
    // Prompt user for charge of an electron
    printf("Enter the charge of an electron (usually 1.602e-19): ");
    scanf("%le", &chargeE);
    
    // Calculate number of electrons
    electrons = charge / chargeE; // Correcting the logic
    
    // Display result in scientific notation
    printf("Total number of electrons = %le\n", electrons);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Explanations
1. **`double` for Floating-Point Precision**:
   - We use `double` instead of `float` for higher precision.
   - `float` typically holds **6‚Äì7 decimal digits**, whereas `double` holds **15‚Äì16 decimal digits**.
   - Since we are dealing with very small numbers, `double` ensures better accuracy.

2. **Scientific Notation (`%le` and `%lf`)**:
   - `%le` is used for scanning and printing floating-point numbers in **scientific notation**.
   - `%lf` is used for normal floating-point values.
   - **Example Inputs & Outputs:**
     - Input: `1.5e-6` (1.5 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∂ Coulombs)
     - Output: `Total number of electrons = 9.366e+12`

3. **Corrected Syntax & Fixes:**
   - **Fixed `Scanf` syntax:** Should be `scanf("%le", &charge);` (not `Scanf` with uppercase `S`).
   - **Fixed `print` function:** Should be `printf` instead of `print`.
   - **Removed multiplication by `-1`**: The charge itself determines polarity, so we don‚Äôt need to manually multiply by `-1`.

### Example Run
#### Input:
```
Enter the charge (in Coulombs, e.g., 1.5e-6): 1.5e-6
Enter the charge of an electron (usually 1.602e-19): 1.602e-19
```

#### Output:
```
Total number of electrons = 9.366459e+12
```

### Summary
- Use **scientific notation (`%le`)** for reading and displaying floating-point values efficiently.
- Use **`double`** for higher precision when dealing with very small or large numbers.
- Fix syntax errors (`scanf` and `printf` instead of `Scanf` and `print`).
- The charge of an **electron is negative**, but division already accounts for sign, so no need for extra `-1` multiplication.

This method ensures that we can work with **extremely small or large numbers** efficiently in **embedded systems programming**.
